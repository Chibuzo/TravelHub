    </ul>

    <h3>Terms of Service:</h3>
    We offer our software products as services mainly for technical reasons. You are only required to buy your hardware, we'll come and install
    the software in all the parks/depots you want it, and also train your staff on how to use it. However, if you are interested in
    online booking/reservation, you will have to provide an internet service so that the software can communicate with the web
    platform to avoid duplicate seat reservation.

    <h4>Online Services:</h4>
    If you opt in for our online services, you'll have control and real-time reports on ticket sales from all your parks/depots using
    our software services. <br>
    The administrative backend is only available online, and to be able to receive updates from all the
    parks/depots, the parks/depots would have an active internet service.
    Meanwhile, our software synchronizes data anytime there's internet; this means that internet outage would not lead to loss of data/records.

    <p>To start your free service, reply this email or call us. Our contact details are below.</p>
