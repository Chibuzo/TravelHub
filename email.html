    <img src="http://travelhubng.com.ng/images/set.png" align="right" width="420">
    <h3>The free offer includes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ticketing Software</li>
        <li>Courier Management Software</li>
        <li>Fleet Management software</li>
        <li>Administration Backend for control and reports</li>
        <li>Online marketing and business promotion</li>
        <li>Online ticket booking</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Terms of Service:</h3>
    We offer our software products as services mainly for technical reasons. You are only required to buy your hardware. We will install
    the software in all the parks/depots you want it, and also train your staff on how to use it. We also offer all the technical help
    you might require to keep our services running smoothly.<br>
    However, if you are interested in
    online booking/reservation, you will have to provide an internet service so that the software can communicate with the online ticketing
    platform to avoid duplicate seat reservation.

    <h4>Online Services:</h4>
    If you opt in for our online services, you'll have control and real-time reports on ticket sales from all your parks/depots using
    our software services. <br>
    The administrative backend is only available online, and to be able to receive updates from all the
    parks/depots, the parks/depots would have an active internet service.
    Meanwhile, our software synchronizes data with the cloud server whenever there's an active internet connection; this means that internet outage or disruption would not lead to loss of data/records.

    <p>If you will want to enable online ticketing on your official website, we will plug our online ticketing API service into your website, and
        you'll be up!</p>

    <p>To find out more about our services, please <a href="http://travelhubng.com.ng">visit our official website</a>.<br>
